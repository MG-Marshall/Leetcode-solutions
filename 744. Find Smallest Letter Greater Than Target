You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.
Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.
Example 1:
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"
Example 2:
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
Output: "f"
Example 3:
Input: letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"
Output: "x"

class Solution {
public:
    char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) {
        char temp = 123;
        int flag = 0;
        for(char c : letters){
            if(c > target && c < temp){
                temp = c;
                flag = 1;
            }
        }
        if (flag == 0) 
            return letters[0];
        return temp;
    }
};
