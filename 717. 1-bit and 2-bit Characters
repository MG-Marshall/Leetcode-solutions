We have two special characters:
The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).
Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.
Example 1:
Input: bits = [1,0,0]
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: bits = [1,1,1,0]
Output: false

class Solution {
public:
    bool isOneBitCharacter(vector<int>& bits) {
        int n = bits.size(), flag = 1;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(bits[i] == 1) {
                flag = 0;
                i++;
            } else flag = 1;
        }
        return flag;
    }
};
